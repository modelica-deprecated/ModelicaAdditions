# ModelicaAdditions Library

This library is deprecated since it has been incorporated in a slightly improved form into the Modelica Standard Library, version 2.1.

## Library description

Package `ModelicaAdditions` is a collection of libraries which is supplied by DLR (Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt) to provide often needed components which are missing in the Modelica standard package. It is planned to provide the components of package ModelicaAdditions in an improved form in a future version of package Modelica. In the subpackages of `ModelicaAdditions` it is explained why the corresponding sublibrary is not yet included in package Modelica.
